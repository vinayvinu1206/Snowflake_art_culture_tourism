This project is a comprehensive data visualization and analytics dashboard built using Streamlit and powered by Snowflake as the backend. The application explores the intersection of art, culture, tourism, and technical education in India using real government datasets.

The key modules include:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Culture Fund Utilization
Analyzes Ministry of Cultureâ€™s fund allocation and utilization over the years. Uses dual Y-axis visualizations to highlight gaps between funds allotted and spent. Helps identify patterns of underutilization and improve transparency.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Tourism Trends
Explores historical trends in domestic and foreign tourist numbers since 1991. Annotated charts reveal insights into peaks, drops (e.g., during COVID-19), and long-term growth patterns crucial for policy and marketing strategies.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Heritage Project â€“ Mubarak Mandi Palace Case Study
Presents a real-world conservation effort with detailed breakdowns of development components and estimated costs. Offers a data-backed view into how heritage conservation projects are scoped, phased, and funded.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Art & Technical Training â€“ ITI/ITC Landscape
Analyzes intake capacity and count of Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) across states. Includes bar and scatter plots to reveal skilling patterns and potential gaps in technical education infrastructure.

ðŸ”§ Technical Highlights:
Python stack using pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, Streamlit

Snowflake for centralized, scalable, and secure data management

Dynamic, interactive dashboards for policy planning, cultural heritage management, and educational strategy

This project not only showcases data integration and visualization skills, but also demonstrates how technology can support India's cultural and tourism ecosystems through meaningful, accessible storytelling.
